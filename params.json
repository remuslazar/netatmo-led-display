But because of the bad performance and missing\r\nfeatures (green led was not implemented), the whole hardware related\r\nstuff was rewritten from scratch and integrated in the `LEDDisplay`\r\nlibrary, which is bundled with this project (separate library, can be\r\nused also for other projects as well).\r\n\r\nUsing the current implementation, the matrix refresh cycles (full\r\nrefresh running on 100Hz) do use only about 12% of the 16MHz CPU,\r\nleaving enough room for the main application.\r\n\r\n\r\nPCB / Eagle\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nA custom Arduino-shield is provided for the connection between the\r\nArduino and the LED Display. To minimize costs the shield is one-sided\r\n(TOP coper).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* [LDP-6432 LCD Matrix Display](http://www.embeddedadventures.com/led_matrix_display_LDP-6432.html)\r\n* [ATmega32U4 Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/7766s.pdf)\r\n* [Adafruit GFX Lib Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library.pdf)\r\n* [Adafruit GFX Arduino Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)\r\n* [Ultrathin LED Matrix Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Ultrathin_LED_Matrix)\r\n* [GLCD Library](https://github.com/andygock/glcd)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
